# Robotic Head for Educational Use

**Intermediate-Level Project:** This repository contains code and instructions to build a robotic head for educational purposes. Learn about servos, basic mechanics, and control logic used in robotics and animatronics.

## Features

- Neck scanning (left-right)
- Simulated jaw and eye movement
- Easy to assemble with off-the-shelf components

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno/Nano
- 3x Servo motors (SG90 or MG90s)
- Jumper wires & breadboard
- Power supply for servos

## How to Run

1. Wire the servos to pins 9, 10, and 11 on your Arduino.
2. Upload the `robotic_head.ino` file using Arduino IDE.
3. Power the Arduino and observe movements simulating basic head animation.
